# Stealth Game Prototype
A basic prototype of some stealth mechanics:
- enemy vision cones and detection
- enemy investigation of detected noise (symbolized by white circles)
- player movement noise, and enemy "hearing" detection
- tracking and chasing of player once detected

Player can be controlled with WASD, and SHIFT used to "sprint".
